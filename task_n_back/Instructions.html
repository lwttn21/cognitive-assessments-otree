        In this experiment, you will see a series of letters appearing one after another.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your task is to determine whether the current letter is the same as the one you saw
        <strong>{{ n }} position(s)</strong> ago.
    </p>

    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <strong>Rule:</strong> Press the <b>SPACEBAR</b> if the current letter matches the letter from {{ n }} step(s) back.
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li>If a letter appears that does NOT match, do <b>not</b> press any key.</li>
        <li>Try to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please place your finger on the spacebar now and click "Next" when you are ready to begin.</p>
